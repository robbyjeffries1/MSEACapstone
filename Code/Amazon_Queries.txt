There are 43 distincts product categories

SELECT DISTINCT Year
FROM amazon_reviews_parquet
ORDER BY Year DESC;

The data is supposed to span 20 years from 1995 to 2015.
However, I noticed that some reviews where made in 1973. I will investigate further.

SELECT *
FROM amazon_reviews_parquet
WHERE Year = 1973

Only one review was made in 1973. It is in japanese.
I didn't know there where japanese reviews. This led me to investigate how many different countries are present.

SELECT DISTINCT Marketplace
FROM amazon_reviews_parquet

There are 5 countries: DE, US, FR, UK, JP
Those are Germany, United States, France, and Japan.

#	marketplace	Total_Reviews
1	US	157893444
2	UK	1707494
3	DE	679121
4	JP	262431
5	FR	254080

As expected, there are more reviews coming from the US (158 millions).
But, other countries have a fair number of reviews.

I wonder how many duplicates reviews there are in each country 

SELECT 'US', (SELECT COUNT(review_id)
FROM amazon_reviews_parquet
WHERE marketplace='US')
-
(SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT review_id) 
FROM amazon_reviews_parquet
WHERE marketplace='US') as Duplicates

UNION 

SELECT 'UK', (SELECT COUNT(review_id)
FROM amazon_reviews_parquet
WHERE marketplace='UK')
-
(SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT review_id) 
FROM amazon_reviews_parquet
WHERE marketplace='UK') as Duplicates

UNION

SELECT 'DE', (SELECT COUNT(review_id)
FROM amazon_reviews_parquet
WHERE marketplace='DE')
-
(SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT review_id) 
FROM amazon_reviews_parquet
WHERE marketplace='DE') as Duplicates

UNION

SELECT 'JP', (SELECT COUNT(review_id)
FROM amazon_reviews_parquet
WHERE marketplace='JP')
-
(SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT review_id)

UNION

SELECT 'FR', (SELECT COUNT(review_id)

WHERE marketplace='FR')
-
(SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT review_id) 
FROM amazon_reviews_parquet
WHERE marketplace='FR') as Duplicates;

#	_col0	Duplicates
1	DE	0
2	JP	0
3	UK	0
4	FR	0
5	US	6931166

Surprisingly, only US has duplicates reviews

How many customers by Countries?

SELECT marketplace, COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) as customers
FROM amazon_reviews_parquet
GROUP BY marketplace
ORDER BY customers DESC;

#	marketplace	customers
1	US	33497620
2	UK	936722
3	DE	373956
4	FR	131386
5	JP	122441

I just found out where the duplicates come from. 

WITH SUB as (SELECT review_id, customer_id, COUNT(product_id) as Number_of_products
FROM amazon_reviews_parquet
GROUP BY review_id, customer_id
HAVING COUNT(product_id) = 2
ORDER BY Number_of_products DESC)

SELECT COUNT(*) as "Reviews with two products" FROM SUB

#	Reviews with two products
1	6931166

Few US Customer wrote a review for two different product in the same review.
I didn't find any occurences where there were more than 2 products.

Let's zoom in on those duplicates reviews

WITH SUB as
(SELECT review_id, customer_id, product_id, review_headline, review_body, review_date,
ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY review_id, customer_id ORDER BY product_id) as row_num,
COUNT(product_id) OVER(PARTITION BY review_id, customer_id) as number_of_products
FROM amazon_reviews_parquet)

SELECT * FROM Sub
WHERE number_of_products = 2
LIMIT 10

#	review_id	customer_id	product_id	review_headline	review_date	row_num	number_of_products

I thought that the reviews or the products would be different, but it seems like they are the same.

How many of those reviews were made for verified purchases?

SELECT verified_purchase, COUNT(*) as n,  
COUNT(*)*100 / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER() as Percentage
FROM amazon_reviews_parquet
GROUP BY verified_purchase
ORDER BY n DESC

#	verified_purchase	n	Percentage
1	Y	124750163	77
2	N	36046407	22

Average Star Rating

SELECT marketplace, AVG(star_rating) as average_rating
FROM amazon_reviews_parquet
GROUP BY marketplace
ORDER BY average_rating

#	marketplace	average_rating
1	US	4.204475145909162
2	JP	4.213210329572345
3	DE	4.25173275454595
4	FR	4.256238192695214
5	UK	4.379853750584189

On average those reviews are very positive

I wonder what is the distribution of the start rating

SELECT star_rating, COUNT(*) as n, 
COUNT(*)*100 / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER() as Percentage
FROM amazon_reviews_parquet
GROUP BY star_rating
ORDER BY star_rating DESC

#	star_rating	n	Percentage
1	5	99530924	61
2	4	27996469	17
3	3	12900929	8
4	2	7700647	4
5	1	12667601	7
